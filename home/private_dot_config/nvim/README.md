# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim based Neovim

See [Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for more info.


## notes

I added the snakemake files from [here](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/tree/main/misc/vim) manually because `lazy.vim` doesn't play super nice with `rtp` modification and I didn't want to figure it out.
