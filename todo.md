# oizys todo's

## oizys

- [ ] nix-eval-jobs errors are not printed on error
- [ ] `oizys gha <workflow>` should keep checking for something greater than the current time
- [ ] `nix run . -- cache` has file descriptor issues that `./result/bin/oizys cache`
- [ ] I don't know that the lix built by `nix build .#lix` is the same as the one included in the nixos config due to the lix module
  this seems to be a `nix-eval-jobs` bug and `lix` is cached and fetched by `lix`

## software

- [ ] why is my update ci always building llm and rofi?
- [ ] include langservers for enabled languages?

- [ ] deprecate llm derivations if there are no issues with `llm-nix`
