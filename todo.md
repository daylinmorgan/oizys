## oizys

- [ ] `oizys gha <workflow>` should keep checking for something greater than the current time
- [ ] remove the implicit dep on `jq`

Possible weird networking errors as a result of the dayl.in build?
get spammed with: `lseek() failed on /proc/net file: Illegal seek`

It's possible this error is only on `lix`
I opened a nix-shell with "nixpkgs#nix" and `sudo nix build` did not result in lseek errors
As a stop-gap I switched to lixPackageSets.git

## software

- [x] add auto-sleep functionality to niri environment
- [x] eww based bluetooth module not updating?
- [ ] volume total in eww bar is wrong
- [ ] neovim + ghostty + clipboards are spamming me ?
      looks like it might be this environment: equation is ghostty => distrobox (arch) => neovim
