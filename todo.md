- [ ] remove implicit dep on `jq`

## software

- [x] add auto-sleep functionality to niri environment
- [x] eww based bluetooth module not updating?
- [ ] volume total in eww bar is wrong
- [ ] neovim + ghostty + clipboards are spamming me ?
      looks like it might be this environment: equation is ghostty => distrobox (arch) => neovim
